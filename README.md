# Noah-SVG-Logo-Maker
Challenge 10

## Description
I built this project to further demonstrate my understanding of using Node.js. While working on this project, I proved my knowledging of knowing how to initialize a project and install packages on it (using "npm init", and "npm install"). For my application, I used the package "inquirer" to help collect user feedback from prompts given in the terminal. I also used the package "jest" to write tests for making sure that my functions are capturing the correct inputs and generating the correct shapes.

I had never written tests on my own prior to working on this project, so doing so helped improve upon my understanding of jest. I was also able to figure out how to extend classes and implement the use of inheritance, which helped when I created sub-classes of my initial "shapes" class. This project also showed me how svg's are created, and I was able to learn a bit about how you can use x/y cordinate pairs to generate different shapes. Lastly, I learned about the importance oforganzing/sorting different files on an application, as this was one of my first projects that I've fully "separated out" a lot of my code - thus requiring me to learn how correctly export/import files through my application.

## Installation
This project is NOT deployed on GitHub Pages, but installation and usage of the project can be viewed in the screencastify video in the link provided below.

## Usage
This project is used to create a personal generated SVG file. Upon invoking the application, a user can go through a list of several command-line prompts in order to specify the chracteristics that they would like their SVG file to have. The user can choose between three shapes, five colors for the shape, and up to three chracters of text to be displayed on top of the shape. They also have the ability to choose a color for the overlaying text. Once everything is submitted, the user's input will be used to generate one 300x200px SVG file, which will be written as "logo.svg" and can be viewed in the browser.
